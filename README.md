## Algorithms

This repository contains solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, ranging from basic to advanced levels. The primary focus is on enhancing my problem-solving skills and deepening my understanding of algorithms through regular practice.

## Language Used
- C++
- C

## Structure
The problems are categorized into different sections based on their difficulty and the type of algorithm or data structure they focus on:
1. **Basic DSA Problems**
   - These cover fundamental concepts such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
   
2. **Intermediate Problems**
   - Problems in this section cover more complex topics like sorting algorithms, recursion, and dynamic programming.
   
3. **Advanced Problems**
   - This section includes advanced topics such as graph algorithms, greedy methods, and advanced dynamic programming techniques.

## Purpose
The repository is purely for **personal practice** and to track progress as I explore and solve DSA problems. All solutions are implemented from scratch to ensure a deep understanding of the concepts.

Feel free to explore the repository and suggest improvements or additional challenges.
